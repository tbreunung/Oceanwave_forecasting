# Content
This repository provides code to reproduce the findings and figures of [1]. 

The code 'Ocean_wave_forecast.m' reproduces the forecasting experiments for the buoy close to San Nicholas Island. Please view the source code for extensive documentation and comments. 

The code 'Wave_tank_forecast.m' is an adaptation of the code 'Ocean_wave_forecast.m' to the setting of the experimental wave tank. For comments and additional explanations please view the source code of 'Ocean_wave_forecast.m'
